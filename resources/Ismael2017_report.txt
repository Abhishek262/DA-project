This paper presents various driving behaviour on wet and dry roads conditions. 
In the UK, road accidents due to weather conditions has been one of the traffic safety
challenges for researchers as well as drivers particularly in Manchester. This is
because of its influence on driver behaviour approaching traffic lights on the road bends.
The model uses data that were obtained from police reports of road accidents at hazardous locations
in Greater Manchester between 2011 and 2015. The assumption is that the data would be a appropriate
representation for UK as a whole.The analysis was focused on the association between road surface
and some important variables such as lighting conditions, speed limits and severity of accidents, were
investigated by Chi-square test. The analysis showed that road surface significantly contributed to
accidents at bend roads. Another major inference was that speeding is a major factor in accident occurrence.
The situation may result in accident with the oncoming vehicle while lane changing or braking suddenly
to avoid collision.
