The paper constitutes of various levels of data analytics namely: Descriptive
statistical analysis; inferential statistical analysis; machine learning.
The aim of this data analysis is to explore the factors that could have an
impact on the number of accidents and their associated fatalities. The analysis
done in this paper would help us to further build our understanding to 
analyze traffic accidents related factors.

Some assumptiions made by the paper include: the increase in population of the
UK leads to more vehicles, which in turn, leads to more traffic accidents and
approximate normal distribution of the dataset.

Results from the paper's inferential statistical analysis suggest that road users
are more susceptible to being involved in an accident at certain times of the day.
Furthermore, the most number of accidents occured at 30mph speed limit but 60mph
speed limit had the highest number of fatalities. Number of casualties increased 
proportionately to the speed limit.

The fact that road users are susceptible to accidents at certain times of the 
day is a major takeaway to analyze the root cause of traffic accidents. The application
of several machine learning models reveal that the accuracy score of the Random Forest 
model is approximately 85% which could be further enhanced by selecting more effective 
features. This tells us that feature selection would be important to analyze accident
severity and accident cause.
