# DA-project

Team Name : A.A.N.A
Topic : Analysis of the factors affecting traffic accidents in the UK.


EDA_Visualisation consists of the various EDAs done for the traffic accidents dataset as .ipynb files. 
Exporting the dataset (via Kaggle) and running the file should result in the correspoding graphs/analysis done.

Reports consists of the First and Second stage report as pdfs.

Resources contains the important (but not all) research papers referenced for use in the project with their corresponding summaries.

Src is where the source code for model testing and training for the various models used in the report resides.
Running the .ipynb files should result in the metrics we have observed in the report itself.
